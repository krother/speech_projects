# Panel Discussion

An exchange with experts can be done as a moderated **panel discussion**.

## Step 1: Find 2-4 people for the discussion panel

Ask 2-4 experts to be available for questions. The others come up with questions. Ideally, the experts have a diverse background. Try to keep your panel well-balanced. Three experts representing *one option* and only one favoring *an alternative* are not a good idea.

## Step 2: Set a title for the entire session

Open questions are generally more encouraging, e.g. *"How to maintain a database?"*, *"What comes after machine learning?".* You can vizualize the title by projecting it on a screen or writing it on a board in big letters. Also the total time for the panel discussion should be known to everybody well in advance.

## Step 3: Prepare the room

The panel and chairperson should sit behind a table. Without the table the panel may feel exposed and uncomfortable. If the audience is larger, an elevated table is better. If the room is smaller, you may put name tags on the table.

## Step 4: Briefs the experts

Tell the panel in advance how you are going to start (e.g. by introducing everybody). Tell them what is the time limit for each answer (if any) and how you will remind them if they go over time. Ask them for questions. Be nice to them.

Give the audience time to prepare questions while you brief the panel.

## Step 5: Open the panel

Announce the title, Welcome the experts and guests. Give the experts time to introduce themselves or state their expertise briefly.

## Step 6: Moderate the discussion

Your job will be to moderate the discussion. Keep it flowing, but restrain yourself to add any opinions or content, because that would make your experts look a bit stupid. Focus on creating a good mood instead.

Collect questions from the audience, rephrase them clearly, and pass them to
the experts without further comment. Eventually, experts may want to take over questions from each other.
In case the audience runs out of questions, you might want to pass a question through each panelist. Also have a few spare questions in stock.

## Step 7: Track time

Make sure that the discussion stays on the topic and prevent individual panelists from talking too much. If the panelists reach a hot or controversial topic you may decide to let the discussion flow for a while.

The total time of the discussion should not exceed 45'.

## Step 8: Close the meeting

Announce that the discussion is near the end. Give each panelist room for some closing remarks. Thank everybody for coming. Thank your panel â€“ after all, it is them who made the discussion happen.
