# Impromptu Speech Moderator

## Your task

As Impromptu Speech Moderator yours is a key role of a speech club meeting. Your task is to prepare and conduct the impromptu speaking part of the session, so that participants can rehearse impromptu speaking.
Your responsibility is to make this part run smoothly.

## Before the meeting

* Ask the chairperson of the meeting whether there is a theme of the day to which you could adjust the impromptu speeches.
* Prepare 5-7 questions for impromptu speakers.
* Keep the questions rather simple - short, precise questions are the best.
* Prepare a few easy speeches for guests, leave the hard ones for experienced speakers.


## Sequence of moderation

* Erplain briefly why we rehearse impromptu speaking.
* Explain the time frame (1-2 minutes per speech).
* Present your theme (if there is one). 
* Proceed to the impromptu speeches themselves: Read the first question, only after that announce the first speaker.
* Welcome the speaker to the stage and step aside.
* Proceed to the next question, and so on.
* After the speeches, ask the timer for a report.
* Repeat the names of the speakers and the questions. Ask the audience to elect the best speaker.


## Time

20 minutes
 
## Hints

* Ask guests during the break whether they would like to give an impromptu speech.
* **Important:** If a guest does not wish to participate, do not call them forward.
* Club members are obliged to participate. Prefer members without a speech or major role in the meeting.
* The first impromptu speaker should be an experienced member.
* Keep the suggested time frame. Extend or reduce the number of impromptu speeches if necessary.
