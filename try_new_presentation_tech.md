# Try a new Presentation Technology

## Your Goal

Give a presentation using a presentation technology you have never used before.

## Description

There is a huge variety of technologies you can use to support your presentation. All of them have their pros and cons. An experienced speaker needs to command at least a few different technologies in order to adjust presentation style to demands of the situation. Your task in this project is to pick a technology you have never used on a stage before and get comfortable with it. This will help you to 

Such technologies include:

* presentation software (PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi)
* flipchart
* whiteboard, blackboard
* a deck of HTML slides (using S5 or [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js))
* presenting from a mobile phone
* the presentation mode of a speacial program (e.g. a programming IDE)
* including a sound file or video in your talk
* a remote control
* the presentation program showing you notes and slides to the audience
* a teleprompter

For this project, prepare a presentation on a topic you are well familiar with. Make sure you have one or more visual aids to show. If you have never used the presentation technology before, it may be a good idea to test it before you enter the stage.

### Typical problems

Unfamiliar technology bears a couple of frequent pitfalls. These are embarassing and waste the time of your audience. Also, they are often unnecessary. Typical problems to watch out for include:

* missing iPhone adapter
* missing HDMI or VGA port or cable
* bad screen resolution
* speaker talking to the screen or board all the time
* there is no flipchart paper available
* the flipchart/whiteboard markers do not work
* video is replaced by a black box on the screen
* sound volume too low to be understood
