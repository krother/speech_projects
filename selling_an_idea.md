# Project 4: Selling an Idea

Persuade a mixed audience (technical and non-technical people) to adopt a certain point of view. It could be to use a certain technology, believe an interpretation or make a decision in a certain way. The project is to engage your audience emotionally in the beginning, and then move quickly to support your point with facts.

One possible strategy is to use the **AIDA** schema:

1. **Attention**: Evoke a positive response in the first minute.
2. **Interest**: Convince the audience why the presentation is relevant to them.
3. **Desire**: Support your point by facts and details, slowly building up a real demand for what you are *"selling*".
4. **Action**: At the end, state what specific step your audience could take.

The best persuasive presentations use stories. A story could be an authentic personal experience, or it could be a problem-solution structure that you use to illustrate your point. As a rule of thumb, stories with very few persons do a better job at selling than those in which a bulk of people appears.

If you are presenting to decision makers, always leave enough room for them to make the decision to look like their own.
