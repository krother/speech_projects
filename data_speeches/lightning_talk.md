# The Lightning Talk

![](../images/lightning_talk.png)

## Your Goal

Present a tool or technology briefly to other Data Scientists. Choose a tool that you are familiar with. It could be a mathematical concept, a programming language or library, a web tool or even one of your own projects.

The value of the lightning talk is its brevity. Your project is to summarize the essence of the tool: What is it good for, how does it look like, what pros and cons are there. If you want to show an example, choose one.


## Time

5 minutes

## Questions for evaluators

* Which part of the talk did you find the most interesting?
* Where there any parts that you found irrelevant?
* Did the speaker limit himself to one core idea, or were multiple ones covered.
* How did the speaker manage time during the talk?
* What could the speaker do differently?
* How would you summarize the core message in your own words?
