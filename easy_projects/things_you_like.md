# Things you like

## Goal

Give a speech about a topic you are comfortable with.

## Background

Your first speech does not have to be perfect. What matters most if you want to improve as a public speaker is to get out on the stage and speak. The purpose of this project is to make yourself comfortable on the stage. By talking about something you like, it will be easier to find your voice.

**We believe you have something to say!**

## What to talk about?

Possible topics include:

* a book
* a movie
* a piece of clothing or furniture
* your hobby
* your family
* your job
* an event you attended

## What is not important this time?

In this speech project, we will ignore a lot of things:

* structure
* wording
* grammar
* voice
* body language
* drama
* persuasion

We will deal with these aspects of speaking later. And we hope this is just the first of a lot of speeches.

## Time

2-4 minutes

## Questions for evaluators

* What strong points did you find in the speech? Name one or more!
