# Listener

## Your task

As listener, you will ask questions about each speech and thereby probe whether the audience has been attentive.

* Explain your role when asked by the meeting facilitator.
* Listen carefully and note 2-3 details for each speech.
* Optionally, also note questions about impromptu speeches (one per speech maximum).
* When asked by the meeting facilitator, present your questions to the audience and let them find answers.


## Exemplary introduction of the role

*"As listener I will check whether you are paying attention. I will note 2-3 questions about details of each speech. Hopefully, you remember these, because I will ask you about these during the evaluation session. I am looking forward to hear many correct answers from you."*
