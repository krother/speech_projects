![meeting facilitation](meeting_facilitation.png)

This document contains descriptions of roles that facilitate speaking club meetings. They have been developed and used in the Spreeredner speaking club ([www.spreeredner.de](http://www.spreeredner.de)). We hope they are useful in other public speaking organizations as well.
