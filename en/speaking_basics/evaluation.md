# Giving Speech Evaluations

*"The speech evaluation "everything was great!" is among the worst possible"* (anonymous)

Speech evaluations support the speaker. An evaluation shall help the speaker to recongnize their strengths and weaknesses, and motivate them to proceed on their learning path.


## The Sandwich Technique

The Sandwich Technique is a structure for speech evaluations. The emphasis is on reinforcing strengths, criticism is softly embedded in the middle. It consists of 3 parts:

### 1. Strengths

* say what was good: name specific areas
* give examples, by citing from the speech or showing
* give a maximum of three points in an evaluation speech of 2-3 minutes
* Example: *"I liked your use of gestures. When you spoke about xyz, you used both hands to support your point A"*

### 2. Suggestions for improvement

* tell from your perspective: *"in my opinion.."*, *"I noticed.."*, *"I think.."*
* give concrete examples
* *how* exactly can the speaker improve? What can he try?
* don't start discussing the content. It backfires easily: *"wasn't Hamlet prince of Norway?"*
* limit yourself to no more than three suggestions in a evaluation speech of 2-3 minutes
* Example: *"When you mentioned xyz, this was too fast for me. You enumerated 11 points in short succession. Maybe you could try to focus on less points in more detail. This would make it easier to follow."*

### 3. Summary

* give a brief summary of 1.+2.
* encourage the speaker
* mean what you say, don't repeat a hollow standard phrase
* Example: *"With your elaborate use of gestures and focusing on a few main points I am sure that we will enjoy your future speeches a lot."*


## Frequent Pitfalls when evaluating Speeches

* Content trap (don't retell the speech, don't give your opinion on the content)
* Time trap (don't say too much)
* Discouragement trap (avoid saying: *"you shouldn't"*, *"you failed to.."*) 
* Rhetoric trap (don't make the evaluation a rhetoric piece of art; the evaluated speech is the center of attention)


## More hints

* address to the speaker directly
* talk to the speaker before he gives the speech and familiarize with his speech goals
* understand, where the speaker is in his current development
* when enumerating three points, put the most important last
