# Rhetorical Devices

**by Kristian Rother**

## Goal

Deliver a speech containing a few rhetorical devices.

## Background

A speech is something different than a written text. To build rapport with the audience and keep it, language is the main tool of a speaker. In this project, we will focus on using it properly.

**Rhetorical devices** are an excellent way to construct a pleasant, engaging speech, emphasize key points, and to make it more memorable. Rhetorical devices disrupt monotonous sentences, and the speech gets a more interesting rhythm.

You find excellent examples of rhetorical devices on [25 Giants of Rhetoric by Florian Mueck](http://www.florianmueck.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/25giantsofrhetoric.pdf)

In this project, your task is to build several rhetorical devices into your speech. You don't need to squeeze one into every second sentence. If you place 3-5 in well-chosen locations, you also should see an effect.

## Time

5-7 minutes

## Questions for evaluators

* Which rhetorical devices die you notice?
* Did the rhetorical devices amplify the speech?
* How was language used in general?
* What did you like about the speech?
* What could be improved in the next speech?
