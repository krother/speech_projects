# Introduce yourself

## Your Goal

Give a speech about yourself.

## Background

In the second speech project, you will deal with an interesting but complex subject: You!
Introduce yourself to the audience so that they learn to know you better.

There are different ways how you could approach the speech:

* Give a summary of your life in chronological order.
* Pick 3 aspects of your life and tell about them.
* Describe a single event that matters to you.

Don't try to put in too much content. Your life contains material for many speeches.


## Things to be careful with

Topics you wouldn't tell a stranger you just met, for instance:

* bragging
* addictions
* your crime record
* diseases
* divorces
* other kinds of mischief ..

.. unless of course you *would* tell a stranger.

## Time

4-6 minutes

## Questions for evaluators

* What did you learn about the speaker?
* What strengths did the speech show?
* Were you surprised at any point?
* What aspect of the speech could be improved?
