# Present an Article

## Goal

Give a speech about an article you read.

## Background

In this speech, you rehearse summarizing a piece of text. Familiarize with an article from a magazine or book. If you haven't done this before, a one-page article is enough. The purpose of this speech is to extract the main message from a longer text.


## Time

3-5 minutes

## Questions for preparation

* What is the central message of the article?
* Which words from the article may require explanation?
* Do you need a visual aid (picture, slide, *one is enough*)?
* Do you want to add your own opinion at the end or not?
* What can you do to stay on time?


## Questions for evaluators

* What strong points did you find in the speech? Name one or more!
* What did you understand about the article?
* Would you like to read the article yourself?
