# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I try the speech projects in practice?

The speeches are best held in a supportive environment, e.g. a course or a speaking club meeting. As long as you make sure you have supportive people for feedback around, it can work almost anywhere.


## Why did you start collecting Speech Projects?

I want to create a collection of freely available exercises that can be used to train public speaking.
 

## There is a lot of information on public speaking already. Why another website?

First, Speech Projects focuses on **practical exercises**. 

Second, I want to target specific topics and audiences like IT, scientists or situations, icebreaker activities etc. Much of those are under-represented in the available corpus on public speaking. 

Third, I found very little material that allows reuse under legally clear conditions (like the CC license).


## Do you have a specific goal in mind?

I would be happy to see 50 diverse projects from 10 or more individual contributors.


## Is there a PDF version of all projects?

An English and German PDF and EPUB containing all speech projects is automatically generated on ([Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/krother/speech-projects/details)).


## What kind of projects are you collecting?

This book contains practical exercises in public speaking, meeting facilitation and communication in general. The projects should allow to rehearse these skills in front of a live audience, e.g. in a course or speaking club.

The projects themselves aim to be *short*, *easy to write*, and *easy to read*. Not a lot of theory. Instead, I want to lower the threshold for advanced speakers to share their experience.
