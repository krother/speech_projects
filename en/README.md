# Speech Projects

## What are these speech projects good for?

This manual contains projects to rehearse public speaking and other communication skills.

If you want to improve your speaking skills in a given area, or simply want to become better at giving presentations, there is a simple way: **speak!** Like good runners run a lot and good programmers program a lot, good speakers become good by speaking a lot.

The **speech projects** described here are stepping stones on the path of improving as a speaker. Each project consists of a speaking assignment focusing on one particular aspect of a speech, so that you can develop your skills in portions.

And, most importantly, **this is an exercise that is meant to be fun**.

## How to use the material?

It is a simple three-step process:

1. Find a place to speak.
2. Give the speech for one of the projects.
3. Collect feedback by someone who has read the project description.

The chapters of this book contain projects targeted to specific audiences.

## Where to speak?

The speeches are best held in a supportive environment, e.g. a course or a speaking club meeting. As long as you make sure you have supportive people for feedback around, it can work almost anywhere.
