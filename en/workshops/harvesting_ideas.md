# Harvesting Ideas and Knowledge

To run workshops and meetings, collecting information from a group is often necessary. Here are a few things you can do:

* Participants discuss their experience
* Brainstorming : Ask a question and collect on a flipchart
* Brainstorming: On a sheet of paper in groups
* Participants move freely among three flipcharts with one topic each and write down their ideas
* Hand out cards. Participants collect and write down ideas to a topic
* One Question Survey. Each participant gets one question which they walk around and ask as many other participants within 5-10 minutes as possible. Participants collect ideas and give a report.
* Discuss and Debrief recap. Participants talk to each other for 60', then report some points
