# Speech Evaluation Workshop

![9 Evaluation Roles](9evaluation_roles.png)

## Goal

All participants give feedback for 1-2 speakers according to **9 evaluation roles** such as *eye contact*, *talking speed*, *structure* etc. That way, everybody is rehearsing their skills:

* **Speakers** learn a lot about their own presentation.
* **Evaluators** train their ability to observe and to relay their observations briefly.
* The **meeting facilitator** trains to coordinate a group with many participants.

Because it follows a very rigid script, this workshop is suitable for facilitators with little experience.

## Duration

45-90 minutes


## Preparations

You need to prepare two things in advance:

* find 1-2 speakers who will give a 5-15-minute speech.
* draw 9 cards for the **9 evaluation roles**. You may of course print the picture and cut it.


## Agenda

The workshop consists of the following steps:

| #  | step | time |
|----|---------|------|
| 1. | welcome participants | 1-2' |
| 2. | explain the agenda | 2-3' |
| 3. | randomly assign evaluation roles using the cards | 3' |
| 4. | announce speaker and hand over | 2' |
| 5. | prepared speech | 5-15' |
| 6. | call evaluators (1-2' each) | 6-20' |
| 7. | **BREAK** | 10' |
| 8. | repeat steps 3.-6. for the second speech | 20-40' |
| 9. | Adjournment | 3' |


## Hints

* ideally the speaker has similar experience as the participants, so that some suggestions for improvement can be found.
* take care that the speaking times are followed rigorously.
* if you are not that experienced as a facilitator, have someone signal the time to you as well.
* if there are less participants than roles, leave some of them out. *Serving multiple roles is not beneficial, because the evaluators won't focus that well.*
