# Speech Workout - Dealing with Critical Questions

*A workout with 7 speech projects*

![Workout](critical_question_workout.png)

## What is a speech project workout?

A series of 7 educational challenges that help you to improve your communication skills. 

I'd prefer to call it a *workbook*, except that such a book does not exist.

## Why are you doing a workout on critical questions?

I find asking and answering difficult questions helps to improve my **critical thinking** skills. Also I find myself in Q & A situations frequently in *teaching* and *community building*.

## What are the 7 projects?

1. Time a debate or Q & A session.
2. Ask critical questions after a speech.
3. Answer critical questions after a speech.
4. Chair a debate or Q & A session.
5. Evaluate a Q & A session.
6. Inform about one specific Q & A technique.
7. Publish a speech project from this workout.

## Where do these 7 projects come from?

I developed them myself with some help from my mentor.

## Where can I find details on the 7 speech projects?

Nowhere, there exists no written manual for this workout. But you are invited to [help me write one](contributing.md).

## What do you do before you check off a project?

I ask someone from my speaking club for an evaluation and a signature.

## What do you get when you finish all 7 projects?

Knowledge. Experience. Recognition from my fellow club members and a small celebration afterwards. Also, the opportunity to plan the next 7 projects with my mentor.

## Wouldn't it be more challenging to have 7 speeches in the workout?

I believe communication is a very diverse skillset, and I want to rehearse **all** aspects of it?

## Why is there such a broad mixture of activities?

In my speaking club, we have **speeches**, **evaluations** and **moderation roles**. Having a mixture of them in the workout motivates our members taking all kinds of roles voluntarily.

## What is project 7 about?

Writing up and publishing is to enhance the available [Open Source Speech Projects](https://krother.github.io/speech_projects/). I treat this as an obligatory step to make the material self-improving.

## Did you invent the idea of training communication by doing workout speeches?

No. **Aristotle**, **Cicero**, **Ralph Smedley** and many others have done similar things long before.

## Sounds great! Where can I read more about your projects?
